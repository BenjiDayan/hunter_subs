- should we try to train a mini segmenter?
- should we try to fix some of the issues in SAM: for instance yi (one) bounding box too small, or xiao (small) split bounding boxes
    - some kind of detection mechanism whereby if there's a horizontal line of text, then any area that isn't captured but is either in the middle or either end of the line should be maybe reconsidered
